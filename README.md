# Feature Encoding & Scaling – Adult Income Dataset

## Objective
To preprocess the Adult Income dataset by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features to make the data ready for machine learning models.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab

## What I Did
1. Uploaded and read the Adult Income dataset using pandas.
2. Identified categorical and numerical columns.
3. Applied Label Encoding to the target column (`income`).
4. Used One-Hot Encoding for remaining categorical features.
5. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
6. Saved the final processed dataset as `adult_processed.csv`.

## Output
- `adult_processed.csv` – Preprocessed dataset ready for ML models.

## Learning Outcome
Understood feature engineering basics including encoding techniques and feature scaling and their importance in machine learning.
